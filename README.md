Game Title: Morphology Match

Genre: Word Puzzle

Target Audience: Ages 8 and up

Platform: Web-based

Game Objective:

To identify and match specific affixes and roots across multiple words by aligning matching word parts vertically.

Players can move each word left or right within its row to align matching word parts.

Players can also reorder the list of words by moving a word up or down in the stack to optimize matching.

Matches can be created vertically across more than two rows, allowing for the formation of chains of interconnected word pairs.

Game Mechanics:

Word Set: Prepare a set of 15 words that share common morphological features (affixes or roots) for each round.

Game Board: Display a game board with 15 rows.

Word Manipulation: Implement mechanisms to move each word left or right within its row and to reorder words by moving them up or down within the stack.

Word Matching: Allow users to align matching word parts vertically to form matching pairs. Matches can extend across more than two rows, creating chains of interconnected word pairs.

Visual Feedback: Upon matching or unmatching word parts, provide visual cues such as color changes, borders, or animations to indicate the status of each word pair and highlight any newly formed chains.

Match Checking: Implement a "Check Matches" button to identify and highlight all valid matches simultaneously, including those that form chains across multiple rows.

Scoring: Award 10 points for each letter within a correctly matched pair of affixes or roots. Points can be accumulated across rounds to provide an overall score. Bonus points can be awarded for forming chains that span multiple rows.

Round Progression: Advance to the next round after correctly matching all 15 word pairs or reaching a specific score threshold.

Progression Indicators: Display clear indications of round progression and score milestones, such as progress bars, changing backgrounds, or unlocking new levels with increased difficulty.

Time Challenge: Implement an optional timed mode for increased challenge. In this mode, players must complete the round within a specified time limit to earn bonus points, unlock additional rewards, and face increasingly challenging word sets.
